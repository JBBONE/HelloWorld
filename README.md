# DS OS empowers autonomous organization
**DS operating system enables individuals to entertain, work, and create together, with autonomy, transparency and security like never before —— a decentralized way inspired by JBB.ONE**

# Summary
JBB team believes in Web 3.0. And believes that the exchange of any asset that is of value to individuals can be exchanged as quickly as information. 

Our goal is to provide a blockchain-technology-based solution for pure distributed cloud gaming that comes with a supporting platform, serving publishing, publicizing, trading, and socializing functions. Moreover, through the token-based incentive system, boundaries between creators and players shall be removed, and everyone can hop the co-creation with no prerequisite.

Along with our development, which sees our endeavors to improve environment in gaming field, we also created the DS OS for users to form their own ownerless organizations based on their common interests. Through customization of plugin components, not only that DS OS users bring any desired self-governing decentralized organizations into reality, but they may create all kinds of stuff on the ecosystem, which parallels our creation—— JBB.ONE, ONE World Platform, Blockchain Wallet, NFT marketplace, blockchain game engine, and crypto currency exchange. What we create on DS only represents a tiny portion of what potentially can be created on DS ecosystem, and as more plugins are developing and more third-party plugins or user-created plugins coming, the possibility will be continuing to expand.

## What is DS?
DS stands for "Decentralized Syndicate".  
The JBB DS ecosystem’s empower users to form decentralized autonomous syndicates based on blockchain technologies, which enables users to engage co-creations in an ownerless, transparent, and secure environment. In addition, associations, leagues, alliances, and more cooperative organizations may be formed by collaborations across different DS groups.

● DS provides basic features for users to form ownerless organizations to share resources and value based on common interests.  
●  DS is a decentralized community where users get to choose their way of sharing and collaboration.  
● Customizable DS decision weight allocation and DS rule establishment through collective agreements.  
● Customized functions for DS can be obtained by plugin components.  
● Complete set of operational events within DS group, such as: transactions, profit sharing, and vote system are provided with privacy, security, and transparency. 

## JBB.ONE as DS Exemplar
### JBB.ONE Major Features
Dozens major components of JBB.ONE, including info portal site, ONE World platform, and JBB forum, game engine, and marketplace are incorporated with DS. All these examples not only show how stuff that builds on DS can stand out on its own, but, through flexible choices of combination and cooperations across different DS groups, a huge potential amount of products, business models, and enterprises can be created.

#### JBB.ONE's major features include: 

##### Info Portal:  
● Provides latest blockchain game news, events info, and more insightful/helpful instructions and articles on contemporaries.  
● Covers three languages: English, Chinese, and Japanese.  

##### Co-creation Platform:  
● Enable direct development and publishing on blockchain for games.  
● Games are and will be always available to play due to distribution on blockchain.   
● All games are accessible from PC or mobile devices.  

##### Game Engine:  
● Coding is not required in game development process.  
● Customizable game collaboration.  
● Visualizations during whole course lower the difficulty of game dev to another level.   

##### Game Material Repository:  
● The Material Repository is forever expending to provide more and more originial game material with GAN backup.  
● The intellectual property of content creators is secured by smart contract.  

##### Marketplace for Digital Assets:  
● Real-time high-frequency interaction supported seamless trading experience.  
● No gas fee.

### How JBB.ONE Incorperate with DS OS 
Through token allocation system and visualized online game maker, combining with powerful GAN support, users can realize their nascent idea into an actual game at ease, and all contributors will get the share they deserved, which creates an opportunity for the independent game content creator to solve revenue issues and shall be incentives which leads to massive innovations. JBB.ONE addresses the distancing between players and developers by redefining the way of content creating. With no strict definition of players and developers, JBB.ONE encourages users to form a co-creation community where game lovers no longer stop to pursue their desire to make their own games due to lacking partners, technical threshold, or financial inconfidence.

#### JBB.ONE endeavor to bring down all barriers so users may explore freely:

● A full-fledged ecosystem where users can browse games, make games, play games, and form communities around games.  
● Provides ONE World co-creation platform where game lovers have no obstacles becoming game developers.  
● True ownership of digital assets and tokenized gears that empower players' experience across platforms.  

By setting levels of interoperabilities, users can engage in any segments possible. Thus JBB.ONE integrates with DS ecosystem so smoothly, for its environment is maximally open and free.  
On top of this, the essential hit that has been emphasized by DS is that no one is more authorized than anyone to do anything. That being said, once the DS rules and structures have been finished, anyone can build anything on top of the structure as long as they are rule-abiding.   
Users can come up with functions, characteristics, and features of how they want the DS group to be, by developing and applying plugins, or apply existing plugins, to realize the DS the place they desire. Not only that the DS functions as a standalone organization, project, or product which provides ownerless, secure, just, and transparent environment, but how it may be incorporated into DS ecosystem and embrace co-creation unlocks its true potential.   
All these features are realized with plugins which users may choose to add or remove through autonomous voting system. Where does the ecosystem branch to, we are also exploring. We sincerely invite all interested peers to explore with us together.

# DS
DS is realized and enforced by a series of decentralized smart contracts. While traditional legal contracts are ultimately enforced by coercion from centralization and the ability to physically seize assets in case one party to the contract does not fulfill their obligations, which also does not always carry out smoothly and does not cover up losses in the most cases. In contrary, smart contracts are enforced by "itself" that ensure the contracts are executed exactly as they are programmed. This “self-enforcing” property of smart contracts can reduce the various risks involved in certain types of contracts.   
DS ecosystem is designed for fair and maintained by group consensus, which we believe is the key to genuine and honest co-work.

User behaviors are carried out and concluded on-chain, and all transactions of the DS are recorded and maintained on a blockchain and interests of the users are aligned by the incentive rules set by users tied to the user-chosen token and consensual rules. Proposals take the primary way for making decisions within DS, which are voted for by majority consensus of involved syndicates.

A decentralized syndicate provides higher level of transparency while reducing bureaucracy with self-enforcing code. Users came together for common interests and they remain parity as they were within the syndicate—— no one can take advantage of positions since rules and profit-sharing are enforced by smart contract, thereby, the interests of the party remain pure and unstained.   
Users may design their own rules for the syndicate to keep their party moving towards the common interest. A proper rule may secure that movements are carried out in a way that best satisfies the syndicate members while making not the procedure going trivial and troublesome, which keeps members' passion to create and contribute.

## Prerequisite for Starting Your DS 
All you need is just a working desktop computer or mobile device with a decent internet connection and a blockchain account, such as EOS account.
## How to Set Up Your DS
You may start by click "Create DS".   
You need to name your DS and describe your DS before further customization. After finishing creating name and description, your DS will be created. Here is a brief introduction about two essential features of DS that can be realized by plugins: mint token and vote system. More extended features is await for your exploration. If you have any concerns, feel free to contact with JBB team. 

### How to set up DS token?
Select token types for your syndicate to use: transferable token, or non-transferable token that has unlimited or limited acquisition to token holder.

1. Fungible Token, transferable token that can be mint and assign to all DS members with no built-in limit to the number of the tokens that can be minted or hold by any token holders.  
Example of usage: you may use it to designate payment currency to distribute to contributors inside or outside your DS.   
2. Non-transferable tokens that can be mint and assign to all DS members with no built-in limit to the number of the tokens that can be hold by any token holders.  
Example of usage: you may use it to designate reputation system to indicate the token holders' contribution to the DS group.  
3. Non-transferable tokens that can be mint and assign to all DS members with a built-in cap to the number of the tokens that can be hold by any token holders.  
Example of usage: you may use it to designate a membership system which comes with different levels of rewards.  

###  How to customize vote system?
 There are few basic parameters for you to customize before DS members can create a poll. 
 
1. Minimal Pass Percentage  
Minimal Pass Percentage is the minimal percentage of approvals for the proposal to pass. For example, if the Minimal Pass Percentage is set to 50%, the proposal needs at least 50% of the vote to approve the proposal for the proposal to pass.   
2. Minimal Participation Percentage  
Minimal Participation Percentage is the minimal percentage of token holders' participation required for this vote to be valid. For example, if the Minimal Participation Percentage is set to 30%, then the vote requires 30% of the token holders to participate to make the vote valid.  
3. Vote Duration  
Vote Duration is the length of the time that poll remains active. If the vote does not meet minimal pass percentage and minimal participation percentage when the vote duration ends, then the vote will automatically fail.  

Notice that you can add more tokenholders after your DS has been created.

## DS Basic Feature
The basic contract of the DS will be automatically generated right after the DS organization is created. All desired functions required for the DS can be realized by installations of corresponding plugins. For fulfilling basic functions for DS, installations of vote system and token system are recommended. A compact DS may contain these features: mint token, create vote poll, review& vote, and treasury operation. Through these basic features, individuals may mint and assign customed token to DS members with respects to consensus of the DS member and particular DS rules; make proposals like profit sharing, and carry out through autonomous voting procedures and execution of smart contract; review peer proposals and vote; assign or withdraw treasury token through voting procedures. 

The full instruction about DS basic features see on the website.

## Interoperation across Different DSs
Through installation of plugins, interoperations across different DS groups can be secured by smart contracts.   
It is possible that different DSs want to collaborate with each other for various reasons. For example, a game development DS might want to collaborate with a DS which dedicates to do translations. In case that profit sharing or other user behaviors are unguarded by smart contracts, plugins can offer great helps to enhance interoperations across different DSs. 

● DS to DS Interoperation  
Involved DSs may initiate cooperations and share profits through wallet plugin in various way, which will be introduced shortly. To leverage security and transparency, involved DSs can apply customed or third-party plugins to allocate work and set profit share so the interoperation can be enforced by smart contract.   
● Designate Common Treasury  
Another applicable technic is to designate a collaborated treasury if involved DSs can arrive to consensus. It is possible to design such a treasure that is commonly used for multiple DS organizations. Every deposit and withdrawal are guarded by the smart contract which based on the rule they have agreed on. The specific procedure to manage the treasury is up to the DSs.  
● Form New Temp/Perma DS   
If necessary, they can also form a whole new DS based on their common interest or agreements regarding certain issues, for temporary use or permanent use, to fulfill their needs.   

## Transaction in DS ecosystem
### ● Sending  
You may send your token or token from your DS fund to users who are in another DS group directly.   
### ● Exchange Platform  
Moreover, you may trade your token with other users. Since customized tokens are not anchored to certain value, we provide a peer to peer exchange platform, which comes in a plug-in component. For example, you want to trade your XYZ token for ABC token. There is no price reference on the market, so you made you preferred offer after your evaluation, say, you want to trade 2 XYZ tokens for 1ABC token. Your offer will be posted on the exchange platform, and whoever agrees to your price can accept the offer and exchange with you.  
### ● Sending in other tokens  
If your customized token possesses certain liquidation already, you can use send in other tokens. For example, you want to transfer EOS to another user, but you only have your customized token ABC at the moment. Through send in other token, you may transfer your ABC into EOS and send it to another user with convenience.   
### ● Enhancing liquidation  
You can also deposit them to pools to boost liquidation for the ecosystem, so that the risk of being arbitraged can be reduced. In addition to that, you also get a portion of liquidation shares.  

## DS Court
For any unresolved or conflicting cases, users can use DS Court to protect their shared resources and rights. If members abuse rules in some way, the dispute can be escalated to DS Court where the rest of the DS members decide whether they should be penalized.

# More Details about JBB.ONE
JBB.ONE is the first distributed cooperative community started by JBB team, which empowers users to create cooperatively and share game related content, and it is also an exemplar DS that illustrates what users may achieve with DS OS. 

## Content Creation
JBB.ONE provides the easiest-to-use game engine ever on blockchain. You may easily create a game without coding. Together with game materials that shared or authorized by other users on the platform, all you for creating a game is a genuine idea and passion for work. Plugin for game engine is under development, and will be accessible from DS OS as part of the customization.

### How to create a game
Traditional game maker is like describe an image in your mind to someone else with a foreign language and ask them to re-portrait, while an easy-to-use visualized game maker helps you to express what you have in mind. With ONE World game engine, users can see every potential changes in game in visualized window that their operations bring about, so they no longer need to check for bugs, seek community helps and waste time for unnecessary cause.
Not only that the game engine is incredibly easy to use but the game made out of it is inherited distributed on chain, meaning that game developers no longer need extra works to make the game a blockchain game.
You may start to create a game with a JBB account.

### Multiple supports
#### Translation Support

You may connect yourself with translation related DS group. The transaction happend during service is subject to their DS rule and smart contract.

#### JBB.ONE also provides GAN support that help with content creating, including:

● Automatic generation of illustrations, avatar, background, and more game material in picture, with or without user guidance.   
● Automatic colorization, with or without user guidance.   

GAN support is currently in alpha testing, and official version release is expected in near future.  
GAN support is developed with the newest technologies. You don't need to master drawing technics or possess any background knowledge. You start with a simple idea, put in parameters according to your preference, and adjust the outcome then you may get the material you want. With GAN support, our game material repository is potentially ever-expanding. Additionally, original material created by using GAN support with user guidance can be very popular when it hits the market, which ultimately lead to structural transformation in the industry.

## Info Portal
The info portal is the very first thing you will notice when you log in JBB.ONE. It proviodes articles and videos about game walkthrough, new game infomation, new game events, interview, airdrop , instruction, and side story with three languages: Chinese, English, and Japaneses. Currently, most articles are official news/ articles that authorized by game companies or mediums, or original articles/videos produced by JBB team. DSs which produce original contents may also share their articles/videos on JBB.ONE autonomous channel:  
1. Part of the articles in multi languages was/ will be translated by DS. DS groups which are interested in providing translation for certain contents may submit their translation to review group, which can be another DS group. Translated articles will be available for browsing once the translation review passed review session.  
2. Content creators from DS may post their dedications on interested sections. DS content creators can post topic related content on subareas of the info portal. They may also create a new channel exclusive to certain topic through autonomous voting procedure.  
3. DS may provides articles or videos as independent medium. Through autonomous voting procedure, independent medium of DS organization can create their own channel once its permitted by major consensus. These independent mediums can also provide their contents to other DS groups, including JBB.ONE, which run info portals, as source.  

## JBB.ONE Wallet
 The wallet support send, receive, store, and exchange. You can keep other tokens safely and conveniently in one wallet. With built-in exchange, you can easily manage your BBC and other tokens. JBB wallet respects user privacy, and it does not collect any personal information. Furthermore, there are no value-added attachments to the wallet to trouble you with. It delivers the cleanest experience.
 
Regarding trading pairs:  
● the wallet supports a variety of trading pairs for existing crypto token exchange.   
● trading pairs are highly extendable that, through peer reviewing progress and autonomous vote, DS may add up trading pairs for wallet so liquidity for the ecosystem can be further enhanced.  

## Forum
JBB.ONE provides discussion forum based on blockchain. The forum's board generally covers discussion over games on ONE World platform, games in general, game related businesses like co-cocreation, and contemporary issue. It aims to offer a cozy environment for users to discuss and promote co-creation in the ecosystem. Furthermore, DS users access forums from DS OS as part of the complements to active discussion.

Moreover, DS can:
1. Create subsections and manage them. For DS groups find themselves related to JBB forum, they can create their own subsections and manage through autonomous procedure.  
2. Through DS collaboration and management of forum boards, the targeted subsections can be the exact place they prefer. Different groups can collaborate and create a board for their common interests, and cross-DS autonomous management can be achieved through smart contract enforced rules.  
3. DS organizations may bridge themselves to interested forum boards or independent forum sites to save loads of extra works. Each DS group may have their needs for having a place to present or engage activity, but hosting a place like forum or website may be unwanted cause for this DS group. These groups can mind their business on "public area" by bridging themselves to open forums or websites created by other DS groups.  

## IPFS Node
Exercising JBB team's belief of Web 3.0, JBB.ONE uses IPFS protocol to distribute basically all contents created. By doing so, the peer to peer service saves big on bandwidth and it greatly extend the lifespan of projects on JBB.ONE. To become an IPFS node not only helps with content sharing, it also a step forward towards decentralization. Users may apply for becoming an IPFS node to reserve the content they feel interested in. 

For that:  
1. Users can always locate the nearest nodes for optimized, smooth and seamless experience.  
2. With simplified procedures, coding and environment building are unnecessary. All users can become nodes with few clicks.  
3. DS participants as storage providers can monetize their open storage space to earn token where gainings are directly paid by content retriver.  
4. File sharing trusts can be formed through DS OS, thus users may free their own disk space without risking their security, privacy and accessibility.  

## NFT
### The Value of NFT 
NFT are mainly used for assets circulationin blockchain game. Unlike traditional game, NFT assets are not stored incentralized server, which are not completely owned by users.  
In our NFT marketplace, user can use token to purchase NFTs they want, and they can also sell owned NFTs. It is certainly expected that some NFTs are well designed that users desire to collect. Having possession of certain NFTs also means that users can access to certain corresponding in-game feature in games on the ONE World platform.  
### The application of NFT
● Exclusive Rights  
Some NFTs come with rewards in particular areas.   
● Collaborated Goods  
As mentioned above, NFT may unlock certain feature or give players access to certain in-game items or in-game bonus.  
Similar usage of NFT may apply when two or more DS groups collaborate.  

Current types of collaborated goods on JBB.ONE are:  
1. Unlock in-game chapters or bonusplot.  
2. Gain certain item with bonus throughequipping the NFT.  
3. May contain a variety of usages.  
4. Function that related to gamedevelopment.  
5. Other usages that do not fall intocriteria mentioned above.  
Potentially, there can be more ways to use NFT to designate collaborated goods for DS uses, which are up to DS members to decide. 

## Incentive System
Incentive System is the key to motivate content creators to engage with game development and it's realized majorly based on the platform currency BBC. 

### BBC Mining Mechanism:
There are various ways for users to obtain tokenized currency BBC, such as: check-in, make comment, hit like, receive donation, article/game gets our recommendation, or blockchain account linked(for the first time). BBC is of value like typical cryptocurrency. Not only that all sitewide purchases or value added services can be paid with BBC, but cross-chain exchange with other crypto tokens and cross-DS exchange are also enabled. 

The BBC Mining Mechanism is designated to reward user behavior that contributes to the JBB ecosystem with preset weight to each. Specifically, behaviors like content creating is much appreciated in weight. Basic BBC gaining for regular users are also granted throughout basic sitewide behaviors, so all users may be part of the economic system.

### BBC Usage and Co-creation Incentives
BBC is the JBB.ONE currency that carries various functions. BBC can be used in purchasing and spending over ONE world platform, JBB marketplace trading, and currency exchange with other public blockchain tokens. It basically covers possible sectors, which brings a robust vividity to the user market that users will actively try to gain BBC. With proper consensus and transparent contract set, where profit-sharing among content creators are justified, co-creation incentives are designated to content creators.

### Customized Incentive System on DS
DS groups can motivate user contribution by introducing their own incentive system. By allocating DS users with proper rewards according to their contribution creates incentives for users to actively engage DS events. Although there are theoretically countless ways to create such a system through customized plugins and smart contracts, here is a little suggestion:  
● Token  
DS groups can set incentive system around tokens with token plugin. Starting with the founding of the DS group, SD members can set rules that assign proper amount of main tokens of this group to contributors who has helped the founding process. Such token may be used on purchasing stuff or services within DS group, or, simply, it is of value like other crypto tokens. Similarly, they may apply such system on other user behaviors which contribute.    
● Mining Mechanism  
DS groups can set mining mechanism to encourage users to do something constantly in a long run. Say, a particular DS group intrinsically is in need of cloud service. Such a DS group may set up a mining mechanism to motivate users store and retrive contents from each other so they can avoid using third party service. For each individuals storage provided percentage, they may get a certain amount of shares from treasury, and, for every retrieval of files, the fastest provider gets a certain amount of token. It is up to DS members to decide what kind of mining mechanism they prefer to apply, and application is subject to their scenario.     
● Non-transferable Token  
DS groups may create and release their own Non-transferable tokens. For motivating user contributions, they may design particular Non-transferable tokens to reward certain user behaviors. For example, they may use such token to designate a rank system showing a level of how much contribution they have made for the DS. Furthermore, they may introduce a reward system depending on their rank.    
It is worth noticing again that DS OS is highly extensible. DS users may always install customized plugins to realize all kinds of incentive systems. NFTs, Non-digital goodies, and more ways to designate incentive system is awaiting for your exploration.

#### Reminder
You may start your DS on your own or found it with few mates as long as you have a consistent goal, like what kind of rules you are going to set up for your DS, what kind of content your DS are dedicated to, how internal/external members cooperate, how to share profits, etc. All these rules are needed for the smart contract to realize the autonomy enforcements. It is also considerable to start the DS with nascent rules like vote parameter and complete it gradually with more DS members joining in.   
Just to keep it in mind that the more fulfilled the smart contract is the better it secures the member's rights.
